    <p>
        Rollout was my third year group project. We were tasked with making a game which utilised multiple technologies
        integrated in a compelling package.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our game blended the virtual and physcial by combining Sphero robotic balls with an overhead tracking system we
        built using regular off the shelf webcams and a custom built mirror system to reflect a projector image onto the
        floor. This allowed us to overlay graphics on top of the physical robots and along with a custom Android app to
        control them, we had a battle arena game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players each controlled a robot and had to attack each other by using both virtual weapons and by physically
        colliding the robots into each other.
