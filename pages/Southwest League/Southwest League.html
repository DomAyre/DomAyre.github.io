        <b>Following on from my work with Bristol Quidditch Club, I am the principle designer for the South-West Quidditch League</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The South-West League was created by Bristol Quidditch Club in our first season to further the legitimisation of the sport
        and to give teams in the region regular games which actually matter. Nationally, official competition is limited
        to tournament weekends and previous attempts at a league had failed. With a strong brand I helped to create, we managed
        to maintain a sense of professionalism which was new to the sport in the UK and that has helped the league to be
        a success and it is now in its second season and has two divisions.

    <p>
        The logo was the start of the journey in creating a compelling brand. We wanted it to be clearly a part Bristol Quidditch
        Club and that is reflected in the colour scheme we used. But it should also represent the region as a whole as well
        as being clearly a Quidditch based tournament.

    <p>
        The style of the graphics we use in the South-West League has evolved in the two seasons it has been running. We initially
        used quite a sharp angular look which complimented the style of Bristol Quidditch Club's graphics at the time. For
        the current season however, as the league becomes more independant from Bristol, we've move to embrace the circular
        logo and now we have a very rounded look for our graphics.
