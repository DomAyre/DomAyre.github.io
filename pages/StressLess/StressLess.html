        Stressless was a prototype smart stress ball I developed in a team in my Master's year at
        university as part of an Interactive Devices Unit.

        We built a device using a regular foam stressball with magnets and Hall Effect Sensors connected
        to an Arduino board. The magenets allowed us to know how the ball was being squeezed.

        The idea of this project was to have a regular stressball which could link to the users smart devices
        to automatically sooth with either lighting or music. We built a proof of concept when the users squeezes
        mapped to a color on a screen which would fade as the freqency of the squeezes slowed.
