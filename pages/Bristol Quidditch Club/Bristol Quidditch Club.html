    <p><b>I helped to found Bristol Quidditch Club in 2014 and still work as a Design Officer for the club.</b></p>
    
    <p>
        I was initially brought into the original committee as a treasurer, however I quickly became the clubs primary 
        designer and have designed everything the club uses with the exception of the original club crest. I was 
        elected president in the clubs second season and remained in the role for two years. Under my leadership the 
        club grew to become the largest in the UK with over 50 registered members.

<h6><b>LOGOS</b></h6>

    <p>
        The growth in the club lead us to create two teams and this was the first major design exercise I led in the club.
        We took the existing club branding and split it into two unique yet integrated identities, with the clubs red becoming
        the colour of the first team and the yellow becoming the colour of the second team. This meant both teams felt part of
        the club while having their own distinct looks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The logos were designed in tandem with the kits for each team. We wanted logos which would be purely geometric and could be 
        printed easily using only a single colour. This also led to a bold look which looks good as a logo system across a variety of
        background and contexts. We also wanted the logos to match a pattern which would feature as part of the kit designs.

<h6><b>KITS</b></h6>

    <img src="pages/Bristol Quidditch Club/Kits.png"/>

    <p>
        With the club creating two teams we also designed brand new kits. The kits we used in our first season were very basic, the club crest
        on a red shirt. We wanted to step up our game and the results were very well recieved. Our second teams kit 
        <a class="themed" href="http://quidditchpost.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/2015-best-uniform-contest-results.html">was awarded 8th best in the world</a>
        by the quidditch post's best uniform competition.
    </p>

    <p>
        I led the design efforts for the kits and came up with the designs themselves. We added the shorts later on in the season and that was also my design.

<h6><b>GRAPHICS</b></h6>

    <p>
        During my time with the club, despite holding several different roles, I was always the clubs go to designer for social media graphics.
        I did everything from rosters to weird awards announcements and towards the end of my time in Bristol, I ran sessions to train the newer
        members of our club about how to design graphics so that I could one day be replaced without the quality of our graphics dropping.
