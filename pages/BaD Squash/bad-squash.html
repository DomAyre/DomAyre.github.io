        BaD (Bristol and Avon District) Squash was an app I created along with a team fellow students
        during my second year at the University of Bristol.

        The project gave us our first taste of working with a real client and we had to gather
        requirements, manage deadlines and our own time, as well as deliver a high quality product
        at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        I lead the team and was responsible for most of our design work.
