    <p><b>With two years of studying Computer Science at Bristol under my belt, I decided to work on a project
        that would test my UX design skills which I'd really gained an interest in but lacked the skills to use 
        with Study Planner. I released Mynd in 2014 and while it hasn't enjoyed the same commercial success of 
        Study Planner, I am personally prouder of the application as a technical effort and in particular the design
        and feel of the application.</b></p>

    <p>
        This project was mostly to create a tool I personally wanted as well as an exercise in making a more specialised
        UI. In total it has had under 1000 downloads but its average rating is better than Study Planner at 5 stars. I think 
        this is mainly down to the lack of marketing I did for the application being busy with my degree, it might be something
        I pick back up in the future.

        I've known for a long time I work best with structured notes, and this is something many studies have echoed in general.
        However most mind mapping applicaitons have unengaging UI's which are more suited for technical flowcharts than organising
        notes. In a Graphic Design seminar I attended at University I was inspired by the work of 
        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_how_art_technology_and_design_inform_creative_leaders">John Maeda</a>
        who made a mind map application for leaders of organisations to manage their employees.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This inspired me to create my own application, and as seems to be typical for me, the majority of my work on the application
        came during exam season in my second year.

        As well as pushing myself in UI design, I also used the new technology Win2D which allowed high-performance creation of
        custom graphics making it a great option for greating the custom elements I would need to make Mynd work. The downside of this
        was the fact that a lot of the problems I came across were new problems and there wasn't an already solved solution on Stack Overflow.
