    <p><b>I created Study Planner in 2012 as my first experience with software development and coding in
        general. It was a project primarily for myself and as a learning experience. However it really took
        off, even though I have left it unattended since 2014, it currently stands at over 170,000 downloads
        for Windows and Windows Phone.</b></p>

    <p>When Windows Phone came out back in 2010, its unique take on a mobile UI inspired me to download
        the developer tools so that I could play around with the emulator. With no formal CS education in my 
        school, looking at sample applications was quite intimidating. However during my GCSE exam period I was 
        looking for a method of procrastination and I settled on a 20 part web programming course for .NET developers. 
        This lead me to learn programming for the first time.
    </p>

    <p> After my exams, equipped with this new skill I started searching for a project to work on.
        Throughout my time in secondary school, I always redesigned the timetables we were given for 
        our planners and I knew the struggles of remembering about homework. So I decided to create an app to 
        replace the paper planners we used in school.

    <p>
        Study Planner received plenty of praise on the Windows Store and as a result of high ratings and a relative lack of competition
        it was featured many times in both the education section of the store and on the main store front in multiple locations around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was also given a spot in the top 10 of <a href="http://www.nogginbox.co.uk/blog/top-ten-windows-8-apps">Creativ Bloq App Generator Competition</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        At its peak it was the top application in the Windows Store which wasn't a game.

<h6><b>PHOTO SHOOT</b></h6>

<p>
    Along with digitally produced promotional material, I took some photos of an early version of the application when I was promoting its inital release.
