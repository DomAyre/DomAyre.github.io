        Half N' Half Clock was my entry into the <a href="https://flutter.dev/clock">Flutter Clock Competition</a>. I
        have previously done some small projects and experimentations using Flutter and this is my first fully complete
        project.

        I learned a lot about the framework and it was a fun challenge over the Christmas break.
